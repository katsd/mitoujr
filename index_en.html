They learnt how to realize and create their ideals for their project practically. They weren't able to release the app, so I would like that to be their next task. I hope that they will create services that will change society through the experiences that they have gained through this experience. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">I selected her as she had experience developing applications for smartphones and had a proposal that used an morphological analysis approach towards a difficult topic like story analysis. I would like her to praise her for the fact that during the duration of the program, she was able to create a program that analyzes the scenario morphology on the server side, and aspects such as the emotion graph on the client side whilst analyzing a number of actual scenarios. It is a field that has many prospects, so I look forward to her development. </p>

                        <h5>A Message from Teramoto PM</h5>
                        <p class="text-muted">It is a project aiming to solve the problems that foreigners have when travelling in Japan by being able to overcome the communication barrier. He showed much motivation through taking questionaires at airports before he even started the project. He used a language new to him, but he learnt throughout the program and created a prototype. In that sense, I think this project has also helped his confidence. I want him to keep being able to make use of his ability to take actions.</p>

                        <p class="text-muted">Programming course material is currently literally "a battle between powerhouses". He used his own experiences to search for a kind of block programming that would enable users to shift smoothly into text programming.  I highly commend the fact that through this project, he has not only thought about the ways to express the program, but acutally had users using it. Furthermore, I believe the possibilities that he could come up with would widen dramatically through learning programming even more himself. I would like him to create many things for as long as possible.</p>

                        <h5>A Message from Sasada PM</h5>
                        <p class="text-muted">Mr. Nemoto developed a "listenable keyboard" with voice recognition using a Raspberry Pi. It was stunning of him to perform a demonstaration with not only Japanese, but with English and Chinese also. In many parts of this device he used software and services already widely available, so it was not fundamentally difficult, but I praise him for the fact that he combined those aspects well to release it in a usable state. To be greedy, I would have liked him to make a proposal in which there were many usages of the keyboard. There are many aspects to overcome, but including these things, I want him to play an active part in society using the thing that he has learned during this program. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">Despite the fact that Mr. Yamada is the team leader on paper, Mr. Adachi was the main developer. Mr. Adachi attempted to create software to spread IoT throughout the world by allowing users to use IoT devices without any programming. It was unfortunate that he was not able to perform a demonstaration in the end, but by using it, operating a web service from a Raspberry Pi, users can, besides other things, tweet the input from a sensor on the brower withou using any programming. It is unfortunate that they did not utilize me well enough, perhaps due to the fact that he may have wanted to do everything by himself. </p>

                        <p class="text-muted">Despite being a high school student, Mr. Ohno and Mr. Suzuki already have enough skills to live off, so through this project they were able to focus on learning the development of product making. During the short term, they experienced the following phase of product development: releasing, learning from user testing, and publishing their product ( https://vamboo.net/ ) as an opensource, which should be one of the most common experiences in the near future. I hope they will make use of Mitou community in order to push the boundaries of the community and shape the unknown potentials and possibilities that this community has.</p>

                            He developed an app to help people with poor eyesight to read newspapers. He was able to learn a new programming language, how to use a eyesight tracking device, and the design of presentations through developing an app whilst enjoying himself. Midway through his project he conducted a user test, redesigning the interface whilst talking direcly to the user. This is an important thing when making apps to help others. The functions that were technologically difficult to do will be solved through developing the project further.
